# Event-Management-System
The main objective of this project is to develop an event management
system that will serve both users and event co-ordinators. The aim of
the system is to aid in the management of events (i.e, tech events). The
application will handle different users such as participants and event
co-ordinators, thus meaning registration for different users will be incorporated and the functionality of the application will depend on the
user registration type. Participants will be able to apply to the events
of their choice and co-ordinators will have the functionality to create
different events for participants. 
## Methodology
The author aims to implement the Agile methodology approach combined with the SCRUM framework during the development of this
project, this is suitable as its best suited for small applications without
an aggressive time-limit. JavaScript, a programming language by Oracle cooperation, is a popular language chosen by developers when designing and developing cross-platform mobile applications. The author
aims to develop a hybrid cross-platform application utilizing JavaScript
due to previous experience with the language, additionally the author
decided to make use of React Natives’ Expo framework as the build
base for the development of the application. The Expo framework allows developers to test, run and deploy code for different platforms
using the same code base and allowing projects to be deployed on
physical devices (for testing purposes) during development. The VS
code IDE was chosen as it is best suited for this project as it provides
users access to ready made frameworks such as react native ’Expo’ and
popular user interface libraries such as material icons and react native
paper to enhance user experience. The author will use firebase as the
backend of the mobile application for storage of app and user data.
Firebase stores data in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
The firebase database has gained a lot of popularity due to numerous
additional features such as reporting on user analytics data, crash reporting, firebase auth, and real time database thus making it the most
appropriate database for this project.
